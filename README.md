This is a Final project made using Arduino. Light Bulbs can be set automatically/manually and how many bulbs to use depends on what the user wants. 
It also have an option to set the time and date so the user can select when he wants to use the bulb/s. The project needed date and time handling, data structures and algorithms, and accurate timing of bulbs and lcd.
I Included a video of it working in my fb, feel free to watch my work :) https://www.facebook.com/share/v/1AyH8RrFw3/
