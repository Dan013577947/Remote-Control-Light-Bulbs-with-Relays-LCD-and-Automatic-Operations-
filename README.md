# Remote Control Light Bulbs with Relays (LCD and Automatic Operations)
## Overview
This is a Final project made using Arduino. Light Bulbs can be set automatically/manually and how many bulbs to use depends on what the user wants. 
It also have an option to set the time and date so the user can select when he wants to use the bulb/s. The project needed date and time handling, data structures and algorithms, and accurate timing of bulbs and lcd.
I Included a video of it working in my Facebook and Youtube Channel, feel free to watch my work :)

## Tech Stack
- **Arduino IDE** (ESP32 Microcontroller,I2C LCD, Real Time Clock, IR handler)
- **C++** (loops, dictionary, lists)
- **Hardware** (Wood Box, Relays, LCD, Wires, Bulbs, Buttons, IR Sensor and Remote)

**Note: **    
- The code can be compiled and uploaded from the Arduino IDE / PlatformIO, but it will not show any useful output unless the hardware is connected.
- If you donâ€™t have the hardware, you can still review the source code to understand how the components are interfaced.
## Key Learnings
- Strengthened Java programming skills
- Error handling
